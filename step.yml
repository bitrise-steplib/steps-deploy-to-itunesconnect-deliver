  Upload screenshots, metadata and binaries to [App Store Connect (iTunes Connect)](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) and submit your app for App Store review,
  using the fantastic [deliver](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/) fastlane action. You can upload iOS, macOS, or Apple TV apps with the Step.

  This Step, however, does NOT build your binary: to create an IPA or PKG file, you need the right version of the **Xcode Archive** Step, or any other Step that is capable of building a binary file.  

  ### Configuring the Step 

  Before you start using this Step, you need to do a couple of things:

  * Register an app on the **My Apps** page of App Store Connect. Click on the *plus sign* and select the **New App** option. This requires an **admin** account.
  * This Step requires an app signed with App Store Distibution provisioning profile. Make sure that you use the correct code signing files and the correct export method with the Step that builds your binary.
  * Every build that you want to push to App Store Connect must have a unique build and version number pair. Increment either or both before a new deploy to App Store Connect.

  To deploy your app with the Step: 
  1. Make sure that either the **IPA path** or the **PKG path** input has a valid value. The default value is perfect for most cases: it points to the output generated by the **Xcode Archive** Step.
  1. Set up your connection depending on which authentication method you wish to use:
      - Use a previously set up Bitrise Apple Developer connection, set the **Bitrise Apple Developer Connection** to `automatic` (this is the default setting), `api_key` or `apple_id`.
      - Provide manual Step inputs: either with Apple ID or with the App Store Connet API key. Set the **Bitrise Apple Developer Connection** to `off`. Use only one of the authentication methods. 
          * For API key: provide your **API Key: URL** (for example, https://URL/TO/AuthKey_something.p8 or file:///PATH/TO/AuthKey_something.p8) and the **API Key: Issuer ID** inputs.
          * For Apple ID: *Apple IDs with 2FA are not supported.* Fill out the **Apple ID: Email** and the **Apple ID: Password** inputs.
  1. To identify the app, set either the **App Store Connect App ID** or the **App Bundle ID**. Note that while neither is marked as **Required**, one of the two MUST have a valid value. 
  1. If you want to immediately submit your app for an App Store review, set the **Submit for Review?** input to `yes`. Please note that if you do submit the app for review, the Step will be successful only if the submission is accepted by App Store Connect.

  ### Troubleshooting

  Make sure your Apple ID credentials are correct. Be aware that if you use two-factor authentication, you need to [set up](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/configuring-bitrise-steps-that-require-apple-developer-account-data/#setting-up-connection-with-the-apple-id-and-password) a connection with Apple ID.

  Always make sure that **Platform** input is set to the correct value.

  The Step can also fail if the **Xcode Archive** Step - or any other Step that builds your binary - did not generate an IPA or PKG with a `app-store` export method.

        The input determines the method used for Apple Service authentication. By default, any enabled Bitrise Apple Developer connection is used and other authentication-related Step inputs are ignored.

        There are two types of Apple Developer connection you can enable on Bitrise: one is based on an API key of the App Store Connect API, the other is the legacy method of session-based authentication with an Apple ID. You can choose which type of Bitrise Apple Developer connection to use or you can tell the Step to only use the Step inputs for authentication:
        - `automatic`: Use any enabled Apple Developer connection, either based on Apple ID authentication or API key authentication.  Step inputs are only used as a fallback. API key authentication has priority over Apple ID authentication in both cases.
        - `api_key`: Use the Apple Developer connection based on API key authentication. Authentication-related Step inputs are ignored.
        - `apple_id`: Use the Apple Developer connection based on Apple ID authentication. If no app-specific password has been added to the used connection, the **Apple ID: App-specific password** Step input will be used. Other authentication-related Step inputs are ignored.
        - `off`: Do not use any already configured Apple Developer Connection. Only authentication-related Step inputs are considered.

        **NOTE:** The step will only recognize the API key if the filename includes the  `KEY_ID` value as shown on the examples above.
