title: "Deploy to iTunes Connect / TestFlight (with Deliver)"
summary: Upload the archive to iTunes Connect / TestFlight and you can also submit it to TestFlight Beta Testing
description: |-
  Deploy to iTunes Connect / TestFlight, using the
  fantastic [Deliver](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/deliver)
  Ruby gem.

  **If this is the very first build** of the app
  you try to deploy to iTunes Connect / TestFlight then you might want to upload the first
  build manually to make sure it fulfills the initial iTunes Connect / TestFlight submission
  verification process.

  **Be advised** that this
  step uses a well maintained, open source tool which
  uses *undocumented and unsupported APIs* (because the current
  iTunes Connect / TestFlight platform does not have a documented and supported API)
  to perform the deployment.
  This means that when the API changes
  **this step might fail until the tool is updated**.

  ## Setup guide and notes

  * Register an app on iTunes Connect / TestFlight, on the **My Apps** page. Click on the *plus sign* and select the **New iOS App** option. This requires an **admin** account.
  * Requires an **App Store iOS distibution Provisioning Profile**
  * Every build which you want to push to iTunes Connect / TestFlight have to have a **unique build and version number** pair (*increment either or both before a new deploy to iTunes Connect*)

        fail if it can't enable TestFlight Beta Testing for the
        version, even if the version was successfully uploaded
        to iTunes Connect and only the TestFlight Beta Testing
        submission failed.
